#  _Yearbook_
## _Overview_
We at Team Aviato have created a social network application called Yearbook(), that hopefully will help bootcamp graduates stay in touch after graduation. Users can connect with their classmates via email, links to portfolio sites, github profiles, and Linkedin profiles. Users can speficy what language they are proficient in and whether or not they are seeking employment. They can search youtube for relevant videos about looking for jobs or continuing their development education, and search job listing on Github Jobs. 

## _Technology Used_
Frontend - ReactJs, Bulma 
Backend - PassportJs for user authentication, bcrypt for password encryption, Expressjs, Node 
Database - MongoDb and Mongoose 
APIs - Axios for requests, Youtube Search API && GitHub Jobs API. 

## _Running the Application_
The full application is hosted on Heroku [here](https://aviato-yearbook.herokuapp.com/).<br/>

## _Future Development and Features_
The main goals we have for the future development of this app are as follows
1. Uploading a user's profile picture, rather than linking with a URL.
2. The ability to edit one's profile after the user has been created (coming very soon)
3. Post articles that relevant to a user's job search or continuing education goals
4. More direct communication between users with a messaging functionality.
