#  _Yearbook_
## _Overview_
For this project we created a web app that allows for graudates to stay in touch after bootcamp. Users can connect with their classmates to notify one another about potential employment and trends in the marketplace. As a user is registering for the app they can speficy what language they are proficient in and whether or not they are seeking employment. The pages we inlcuded in this app are a Welcome splash page, a login, sign-up, main homepage & a jobs list. We created this app using Bulma, PassportJs, Express, Node,MongoDb, React & gitHub Jobs API.
